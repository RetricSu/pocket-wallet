Pocket Wallet is a [nostr-based wallet on CKB blockchain](https://github.com/cryptape/nostr-binding) built for pocket change and casual, low-stakes transactions. It uses CKB Light Client to sync the blockchain right in your browser **without relying on any centralized RPC service**. By integrating Nostr with Nip46 and more, Pocket Wallet provides a fully verifiable wallet experience in the methodology of client-side-validation and POW verifications.

This is also an attempt to build a [Web5](https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/web5-extra-decentralized) product from zero and explore the design and implementation of a Web5 idealism. Please use it at your own risks.
